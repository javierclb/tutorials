# Submitting Coding Assignments

## Computational Assignments
Unless otherwise specified, computational problem sets are to be sent as Jupyter Notebooks, with a pdf rendering of the executed workbook.  That is, submit both a `.ipynb` notebook and a `.pdf` output of the notebook.

If possible, **do not** split problems into multiple files, as we would prefer to keep things together in one file for self-contained problems.

## File Naming Conventions
The naming convention of the files is `CLASSNAME_LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_assignment_X`.  For example, if `Jane Doe` is submitting assignment `1` for `ECON546` then the files should be called `ECON546_Doe_Jane_assignment_1.ipynb` and `ECON546_Doe_Jane_assignment_1.pdf`.

Please do not submit a zipped folder, or spread across files if possible, and please follow these naming conventions to make things easier to organize.

## More Hints and Notes
- Remember that you can type LaTeX into your `.ipynb` notebooks, so please document any formulas/etc. as Markdown cells with math as required (especially when answers ask you for theory)
- Where possible, try to use notation in the code which matches the math.  e.g. for parameter alpha, type as variable `\alpha<TAB>` to generate the Unicode symbol as the variable name from the latex code.
- Document your code and algorithms in the code as appropriate, but do not add in comments that are redundant or add nothing to understanding the approach.  For example, if a function name and its arguments are clear from the names what they match to in the math, then no point doing additional comments.
- Use the appropriate style guide for the languages.  For example, in Julia use [Praxis/Naming](https://github.com/JuliaPraxis/Naming) and [Julia Style Guide](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/style-guide/) and [Style.jl](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/Style.jl/blob/master/README.md).
