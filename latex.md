## Latex Notes and Setup
1. Install [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) or [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) or [MacTeX](http://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) or ...
2. Install an editor
    - [VS Code Latex](vscode.md#setup-for-latex) is great
    - [TeX Studio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/) is getting left behind
3. *Optional:* Consider a bibtex management tool
    -  [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a big tool with bibtex support.
    -  After installing you need Better BibTex.  Install with [Zotero Better BibTeX Installation](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/)
    -  After the installation, consider opening `Zotero Preferences/Better BibTeX` and choosing a better citation key format.  One is `[authors3][year]`
    - An alternative to `Zotero` is [Jabref](http://www.jabref.org/), although it is getting buggier and more confusing over time.  You can change the "BibTex key generator" pattern to `[authors3][year]`
