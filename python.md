# Introduction

Python is a a high-level,general-purpose language that emphasizes code readability. It is widely preferred by software development companies due to its versatile features and fewer programming codes. Some of its applications include gaming, screen-scraping and graphic designs. Python contains extensive support libraries which include areas like string operations and operating system interfaces with most programming tasks already scripted into it and therefore the length of codes to be written in Python is greatly reduced. Although Python is not ideal for implementing mathematical models and scientific compared to Julia, it may still remain to be  a better language for cookie-cutter datascience and machine learning tasks in the near future. The global computer giant, Google, has also made Python as one of its offical programming languages. 

# Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks for Python 

Jupyter Notebooks are great to interact with Python and the scientific libraries. They are a *browser-based* application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, formatted text, mathematical equations and visualizations. For more specific information, check out the official website [jupyter.org](http://jupyter.org). 

You can: (1) run Jupyter notebooks on a web server; (2) install and use Jupyter on a desktop. 

To do this, first visit the website http://www.jupyter.org. There, you will find the two options on the bottom of the webpage: 
1. Try it in your browser
2. Install the Notebook

## Using Python Online with Jupyter

This is easy to do. Simply choose the first option **Try it in your browser** which will give you access to a hosted version of Jupyter Notebooks. You will have direct access to it without installing it on your computer. 

## Using Python on your Desktop

This is recommended. Once you go onto http://www.jupyter.org, choose the second option **Install the Notebook** which will bring you to a new window which contains detailed installation instructions.

There are several ways to set up your Python environment: 
1. Installing Jupyter Notebook by using the Anaconda distribution
   - Download [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and follow the notes https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/getting_started.html which will guide you through the installation procedure. 
   - Once you have installed Anaconda, you can start the Jupyter Notebook by either (1) launching Jupyter in your applications menu or (2) opening up a terminal and type `jupyter notebook` folllowing the `$` sign. The Jupyter Notebook application will be opened in your default browser automatically. 
   - Now, simply create a new Jupyter Notebook using the *New* dropdown menu and select option *Python 3* to open a new Notebook for Python.
   
- In [VS Code](vscode.md) install https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python  ?
- Give a simple example of how to run that script and see a plot (i.e. matlplotlib from the python interpreter there)
