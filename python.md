# Introduction

Python is a a high-level,general-purpose language that emphasizes code readability. It is widely preferred by software development companies due to its versatile features and fewer programming codes. Some of its applications include gaming, screen-scraping and graphic designs. Python contains extensive support libraries which include areas like string operations and operating system interfaces with most programming tasks already scripted into it and therefore the length of codes to be written in Python is greatly reduced. Although Python is not ideal for implementing mathematical models and scientific compared to Julia, it may still remain to be  a better language for cookie-cutter datascience and machine learning tasks in the near future. The global computer giant, Google, has also made Python as one of its offical programming languages. 

# Installing Python 

You can: (1) run as Jupyter notebooks on a web server; (2) install and use Jupyter on a desktop. 

Jupyter notebooks are great to interact with Python and the scientific libraries. They are a browser-based application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, formatted text, mathematical equations and visualizations. For more specific information, check out the official website [jupyter.org](http://jupyter.org). 



There are several ways to set up your Python environment: 
1. Set up conda: 
   - Install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
   - 
- Setup conda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
- In [VS Code](vscode.md) install https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python  ?
- Give a simple example of how to run that script and see a plot (i.e. matlplotlib from the python interpreter there)
