## Setup for Julia
1. Ensure that [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) and [Julia](julia.md) are installed
2. Type in `julia` to find and install `Julia Language Support`
    - Alternatively, you can click `Install` from [VS Code Julia](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=julialang.language-julia)
3. To test the installation:
    - Create a new File called `test.jl` or something similar, and copy in something like
    ```julia
    f(x) = x
    f(2)
    ```
   - In the file, go `F5` to run the file.  The first time you do this, it is likely that this will take time so be a little patient.  On the bottom, it may say something like "Language Server Busy"
   - If it shows something in the bottom "TERMINAL" like the following, then it is working
    ```julia
    Main> f(x) = x
    f (generic function with 1 method)
    Main> f(2)
    2
    ```
4. *Optional*: If the above doesn't work, then you may need to manually set your Julia executable.
    - First, find the location of the julia binary.  The easiest way to do this is to open a separate Julia REPL and type `JULIA_HOME` to get something like `C:\\Users\\jlperla\\AppData\\Local\\Julia-0.6.3\\bin`
    - From this location, the file is something like `C:\\Users\\jlperla\\AppData\\Local\\Julia-0.6.3\\bin\\julia.exe` on Windows or something equivalent on other OSs.  For Windows, make sure to double every backlash
    - To set this in VS Code, open up the user settings by opening up the command palette `> Preferences: User Settings`
    - In here, type `julia` to get the julia specific settings
    - Then click on the "julia.executablePath" in the "Default User Settings" and choose "Edit" to "Copy to Settings"
    - This copies it over, and you can put in the path.  For example, `"julia.executablePath": "C:\\Users\\jlperla\\AppData\\Local\\Julia-0.6.3\\bin\\julia.exe"` where the quotes are important.
5. Play around with executing Julia code
    - You can execute a single line with `Ctrl+Enter`, which is a great way to go line by line through the code
    - Execute the whole file with `F5`
    - To see the plotting pane, ensure you have `Plots.jl` installed (i.e. `Pkg.add("Plots")`) and then copy the following into a test file
    ```julia
    using Plots
    plot(1:5, 1:5)
    ```
    - Execute the code (noting that `using Plots` the first plot will take 20-30 seconds after precompilation) and it should show the Plot Pane
6. *Optional, but strongly encouraged:* Setup the `Revise.jl` workflow described in [Julia Notes](julia.md#advanced-configuration-for-your-desktop-the-revise-workflow).  To summarize,
    - Find the `.` files are for your account. For example, it is usually at cd ~ on linux/osx/windows with bash, or in a directory such as `C:\Users\jlperla`
    - Copy [.juliarc.jl](etc/.juliarc.jl) to that directory or add the contents of that file if required.
